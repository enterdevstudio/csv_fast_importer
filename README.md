## Versioning

`master` is the development branch and releases are published as tags.

**We're not ready for the production yet (version < 1.0) so use this gem with
precaution.**

We follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) for our gem
releases.

In few words:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,
>    and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
